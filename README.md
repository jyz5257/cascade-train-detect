# cascade-train-detect
## Project Description
The goal of this project is to train a cozmo robot (a small mobile ground robot) model with the cascade classifier. The cascade classifier is a training method developed by opencv. It is included in opencv package after version 2.0. The training feature is based on Haar feature, and opencv will be used as a classifier and also a detector. 
This repository provides the codes and explanations for training a desired model from scratch.
## Buiding Environment
* Linux 16.04
* Opencv version 2 or higher
* Python 2
